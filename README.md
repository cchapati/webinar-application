# OroCRM Application

Welcome to OroCRM the Open Source Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application.

## Requirements

OroCRM is a Symfony 2 based application with the following requirements:

* PHP 5.4.4 or above
* PHP 5.4.4 or above with command line interface
* PHP Extensions:
    * GD
    * Mcrypt
    * JSON
    * ctype
    * Tokenizer
    * SimpleXML
    * PCRE
    * ICU
* MySQL 5.1 or above

## Installation instructions

OroCRM uses [Composer][1] to manage package dependencies, this is the a recommended way to install OroCRM.

- If you don't have Composer yet, download it and follow the instructions on http://getcomposer.org/
or just run the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

- Clone https://github.com/orocrm/crm-application.git OroCRM project with:

```bash
git clone http://github.com/orocrm/crm-application.git
```


- Make sure that you have [NodeJS][4] installed

- Install OroCRM dependencies with composer. If installation process seems too slow you can use "--prefer-dist" option.
  Go to crm-application folder and run composer installation:

```bash
php composer.phar install --prefer-dist
```

- Create the database with the name specified on previous step (default name is "oro_crm").

- Install application and admin user with Installation Wizard by opening install.php in the browser or from CLI:

```bash  
php app/console oro:install --env prod
```

- Enable WebSockets messaging

```bash
php app/console clank:server --env prod
```

- Configure crontab or scheduled tasks execution to run command below every minute:

```bash
php app/console oro:cron --env prod
```
 
**Note:** ``app/console`` is a path from project root folder. Please make sure you are using full path for crontab configuration or if you running console command from other location.

## Installation notes

Installed PHP Accelerators must be compatible with Symfony and Doctrine (support DOCBLOCKs).

Note that the port used in Websocket must be open in firewall for outgoing/incoming connections

Using MySQL 5.6 on HDD is potentially risky because of performance issues.

Recommended configuration for this case:

    innodb_file_per_table = 0

And ensure that timeout has default value

    wait_timeout = 28800
